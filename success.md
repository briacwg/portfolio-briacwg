# Success Plan

## Plan for the course

I plan to earn an A in this course by completing all assignments on time, actively participating in class, and continuously updating my portfolio each week.  
If I run into challenges on an assignment, I will still submit partial work, pseudocode, or code with explanations so that I can earn at least level 1 achievements and get feedback to improve.  
If I miss classes, I will review the posted notes and Prismia transcripts, download the notebooks, and run them myself to make sure I understand every step.  
By staying consistent and seeking help in office hours when needed, I will keep myself on track even if everything does not go perfectly.

## Office Hours

- [course website (times only)](https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall25/communication/)
- [course GitHub org (zoom links)](https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall25/tools/#zoom-backup-and-office-hours-only)


## Communications 

I understand the right time to use each mode of communication

- prismia : quick in-class checks  
- issue on the class website: fix course notes/resources  
- issue on an assignment repo: assignment-specific questions  
- discussion on the class repo: general class questions  
- email: personal or private matters

## Assignment Policies

### Deadlines

- late assignments are not graded  
- extensions are only for portfolio submissions  
- extension requests should be issues on your portfolio repository  
- reasons are only required in extension requests if it is an emergency and late

### Style

- all code must be motivated  
- all results must be interpretted

### Academic Honesty

- it is never okay to submit chatGPT code  
- the penalty for cheating is ineligible achievments, level depends on assignment or portfolio
