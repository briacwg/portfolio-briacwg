# About Me

## Bio
My name is Briac Werner-Guichebaron, and I’m a Computer Science major at the University of Rhode Island, also pursuing a minor in General Business.  
I’m an entrepreneur at heart and currently building projects across finance and technology, including a private investment vehicle and sports tech products.  
Outside of school and startups, I enjoy following markets, working on robotics projects, and exploring big ideas that connect technology, business, and real-world impact.

## Data Science, to me
To me, data science is about transforming raw information into insight that can guide decisions, solve problems, and spark innovation.  
It blends programming, math, and domain knowledge to uncover patterns and predictions that would be invisible otherwise.  
At its core, data science is about asking the right questions, using data responsibly, and creating value from analysis that can be applied in the real world.
